## My projects
In 2023 I've finished working with [EasyGamesTeam](https://github.com/AGH-Narzedzia-Informatyczne-2023-2024/EasyGamesTeam) on a simple game of **"Rock, paper and scissors"**. In 2024 I managed to implement **hotel management system** and **poker** socket game. This year I'm working with my classmates on **restaurant management system**.

## My interests
* I've been learning to **play piano** since I was 7 y.o. Later I started exploring other keyboard instruments (like e.g. organs and synths). I play classical music solo but I was also a member of **2 rock bands** - [KopernikBand](https://www.instagram.com/kopernikband/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA==) and [Daylight](https://www.instagram.com/daylight.band/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA==) - you may see some of our performances on linked pages.
* My 2nd biggest passion is **travelling and sightseeing**. I've been several times to Croatia, in 2023 I've participated in **WYD'23** (having seen _Turin, San Sebastian, Coimbra, Lisbon, Barcelona and Padua_) and I've also been on a **EuroTrip** with my friends: we've visited _Vienna, Amsterdam, London, Edinburgh, Paris, Milan, Florence and Rome_. In 2025 I've been to _Rome_ for a full week and flied to _Japan_ for almost 3 weeks. In 2025 I've already managed to make a city-break to _Budapest_.
* I also like watching movies, reading books and listening to music ðŸ˜Š
